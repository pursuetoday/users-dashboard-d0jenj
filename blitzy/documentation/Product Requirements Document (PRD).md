- User Authentication
  - Registration with email verification
  - Secure login/logout functionality
  - Password reset capabilities
- User Management
  - Display comprehensive user data in sortable tables
  - Real-time user data editing
  - Field validation and error handling
- Dashboard Features
  - Responsive data visualization
  - Search and filter capabilities
  - Pagination for large datasets
- Administrative Controls
  - User role management
  - Access control enforcement
  - Audit logging of changes

## 2.3 User Characteristics
